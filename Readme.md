# Nerd Book
## Front End

Nerd Book is an application that pulls in github

We are tentatively looking at Materialize CSS for our front end framework.  

#### Home Page
"Nerd Book" will list our user profiles with name, age, git hub repositorys etc.


#### Form Page
Users can input their username (so we can do an api call to get their data), bio, career goals, etc.

## Back End

This information is stored in mysql and posted to the home page.
We will end up having a list of all the students in this coding camp and a way to access their githubs from one location.
